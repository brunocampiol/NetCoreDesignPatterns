Some implementations of common design patterns

So far, implemented patterns are listed below. Feel free to add comments so that I can review them.

Each implementation has it's own project. All of them are console apps. Set the project as startup and run. For more details, check 'Program.cs'.

I'm following the designs listed here: [https://refactoring.guru/](https://refactoring.guru/)

## Creational Patterns

- Singleton
- Simple Factory
- Factory Method
